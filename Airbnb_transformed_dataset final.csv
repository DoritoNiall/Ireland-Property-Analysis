All of the business activities, fun and entertainment happen down by the quays, and everyone lives up the hills. Compass Hill is worth a long walk around, it commands the most spectacular views over the inlet and harbour. Stroll - or roll - into the town to take in the plentiful nightlife, with music and craic in most pubs and bars, fine dining options in the many restaurants. For families, there is plenty to occupy the daylight hours.

I am an extremely social, nerdy, outdoors loving, book reading person. And I adore knowing at least a little bit about everything that is going on. 

I have a bunch of Irish influence which makes me a social story-teller who loves guests.  I enjoy hosting folks as well as traveling. I have spent time living in Argentina, Mexico, France, and Hawaii. I live in Ireland as well as in the States.

The house in Ireland is on my ancestor's land and I grew up going to this house. Previously my daughter and I spent a year remodeling and we hope you like the results.

A key thing about what I offer as a host is what I am looking for as a guest. I can't stand chain hotels. They can be quite luxurious but they always come across as impersonal. Give me a fun walkable neighborhood that real people live, work and play- and That is where I wish to stay. My properties are unique spaces that I created for myself, my family and my community that I can also share with you. 

One last thing, these are my personal properties so there are no surprises about folks who are subletting through Airbnb. I have a great team (Julie and others ) who take care of things when I am away, but you can always contact me directly through email, phone, or various apps with any concerns or questions.

I am a social person so hosting comes naturally to me and I have often had folks staying with me even before AirBnB and the other online booking agents.  Friends stay with me or just toss relations and friends my way to take in. Now thanks to the Share-economy so many things are possible that are community building, sustainable, and amazing.

Cheers,
Nola

In 1691 the area was besieged by the armies of King William of Orange in a battle with King James for the English throne.  Twelve thousand cannon balls were fired across the river in the barrage that ensued. We have one of them!

Things I love include music (being a musician myself), the outdoors, hitting the water, the changing of the seasons, architecture/design, good books, great films, funky art, fine coffee, stimulating conversation, meeting new people....and of course travelling to interesting new places. I have traveled far and wide throughout this world of ours, and now take great pleasure in welcoming people to my own little patch of it.

I finished building my Kerry cottage home in 2012. It was a genuine labour of love; fulfilling a long held ambition to have my own beautiful place in the beautiful area I grew up in. Now I enjoy sharing it whenever possible with fellow travelers looking for an idyllic base in the heart of majestic, mystical Kerry.

Review Sept 17... ""Spacious Period Home,” Galway Centre a few minutes away: 
A dream vacation! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
A large family group made the long-awaited trip to Ireland. Ray helped to make this the most memorable experience ever! Banba House was perfect for our needs and close to Galway as well. Ray arranged a number of tours for us with drivers who went out of their way to accommodate everything we wanted to do. We even went to the pubs in Galway when Ray played and had a blast. He was the ultimate host and the house was amazing...I would go back in a second (and hope to at some point)!

BANBA HOUSE     
Banba House,  Galway Main St -12 - 15 mins.        
Built 1890, 3000 sq ft  historic home.
Large corner lot, lush mature gardens, majestic Chestnut, Irish lime, with other broadleaf and conifer trees.
Located on a smart, traditional, quiet, tree-lined street, literally just a three-minute walk to local pubs, restaurants, and shopping.
We are retiring - selling at end of 2019.
Home away from home., that’s Banba House.

We are the Community Council for the Sheeps head/Kilcrohane/Ahakista and surrounding areas.  You will mostly will be dealing me  Annette  who  works part time for the community.  The funds from the Airbnb rentals will go towards upkeep building and fund lots of community projects such as the older peoples social club, Kids/family Easter egg hunt,  Youth groups etc.


Hi my name is Annette,
 
I am married with 3 children. I moved to the area about 12 years ago, and fell in love with the area as well as a local man....   I work with the local Community Council and my colleague Eileen O'Mahony and I manage the loft accommodation on behalf of the Community Council.  We are part of a great team of people who strive to promote our area and to provide community services for all ages within our local rural community.   

All the proceeds from Airbnb are invested back into the local community.  Money is used to maintain the Alice West Centre and to support local community council projects throughout the year. 

When I have some spare time, I try to indulge my love of music, both Irish and County music.  I am part of a group of Set Dancers that compete in local and national dancing competitions and I am also a member of the local church choir.  

I love meeting new people and thoroughly enjoy when people come to stay with us at the Blackgate.  It is nice to meet people from other parts of the county and from all over the world.  Everyone has their own story, some come to get away from work, some to catch up with the family, and others like to take some time out to clear their head and explore the beautiful area of West Cork. 

People love the peace and quiet the place has to offer. 

I look forward to meeting many more people via Airbnb.  See you soon.

Annette

There are easy walks and also some more challenging circuits that you won’t want to try unless you are fairly fit and take some provisions for. There are several horse riding stables in the area and quite often horse racing or point to point racing which is very popular in Ireland. <br /><br />The local villages of Kinvara and Ballyvaughan are great to visit and have superb pubs and restaurants.

My family and I grew up mostly in Connecticut but Dad was born here on the farm, studied in America, did his stint jumping out of planes for the US Air Force, then worked at Guinness in Dublin and in NYC. Both of my parents are active historians and are really interesting/fun to talk to - and they always make the time to chat with guests - and me if I'm lucky.

I also went away to school, then college, studied in Paris as well, and worked in Boston, Dublin, NYC and Richmond, Virginia before coming here. 

I do a lot of sailing/racing in Kinsale and Crosshaven. And...we are REALLY into vintage motorcycles. Thus, we have started a motorcycle touring business as we are probably the most ideally situated because of our knowledge/love of bikes, facilities and location standpoints - you will note this from the website if you care to look up Glenlohane Country House.

I have stayed in a few Airbnb destinations and it has been really great. This appears to be an exciting community of not only places to stay but also one appears to get to know the host(s) which is what we are all about anyhow.

We have often volunteers from all corners of the world staying with us in our home to help with different projects and in the garden. Our very next project will be to restore an old fishing boat into an accommodation with the theme of a pirate ship!

I followed my passion for the Irish traditional flute to Ireland. Set to be a short stay of a few months, it has extended to become my country of adoption. I've been here over 20 years now, I've studied traditional Irish music, music technologies, played gigs and sessions all over Ireland and in many countries across the world . . Then I decided to settle in my favorite place in Ireland. I love county Clare. I nourish my soul of walks, runs, surfs, kayak trips and cycles around the Burren. I hunted a place where I would feel the wild Atlantic, where I would be surrounded by the sea and yet not too far from all amenities. This place is my dream come true. . .
It allowed me to delve even deeper in my passion for the wooden flute learning the art of flute making under the master guidance of Martin Doyle (www.martindoyleflutes.com) ..
For a few years, I delve into my other passions of health and fitness and qualified as a fitness instructor and a running technique specialist teaching the POSE methode ® of running. Setting up my own coaching business and pushed further afield looking into energy work while studying the tools of Access Consciousness.
I was also a tour guide for many years.
I am currently setting up my own workshop on the ground of the cottage and we will see what incredible creation will come out of it.
...
I believe in honesty, heart centered relationships, clear communication and following the exhilarating path of love and joy for life.
Good humour, belly laughs, adventures, witnessing natures wonders together with fresh healthy food, good company ... and of course good music...  that's the base for the recipe for my own contentment.

I lived in London for many years and then in Cork for many more, before moving back to my native Kerry. I choose this location for it's panoramic views of the mountains all around, which change hour by hour, and for it's large private garden space, which I am slowly developping. I love my work, walking in nature, reading, travel and meeting people from different cultures to share experiences. I love nature's beauties and telling people about the loveliness of Kerry. I enjoy delicious healthy food, lots of walking - especially by the sea - and a glass of good wine. I love to sing and I sing in 2 Kerry choirs. When I travel, I like independent travelling, self catering, the choice to relate or not, as the mood takes me, so I offer that to my guests too - freedom of making your own food, non-intrusive care and comfort. Do your own thing - & I'm available if you need any information, to help in any way I can to make your visit more enjoyable.

The combined passion we share for the culture and nature of Connemara has been our inspiration throughout the restoration of this settlement and experiences we offer. 

We can happily recommend places, events, activities, and experiences – both well known and lesser known – that bring you to the heart of the culture of the area. 

We have received national and international recognition for our cultural programmes, environmental stewardship, and restoration work. Awards Cnoc Suain has won include a ""Global Vision Award"" from Travel + Leisure magazine and a ""World Ethical Travel Award"" from The Guardian newspaper. After winning the Irish award for Cultural Heritage at the Irish Centre for Responsible Tourism Awards held in Dublin in March 2015, Cnoc Suain later won a world award for Cultural Heritage at the World Responsible Tourism Awards held in London in November 2015.

I grew up in England with an Irish Mother an English Father and 5 sisters.
I moved to Cork, Ireland in 1996. I completed a sign writers course while in Cork, and moved to County Clare in 2000. I now work from home as a sign-writer. I live on my own, and take the opportunity to travel to India during the rainy Irish winters.
I love riding my motorbike, and tour Europe on the bike for a few weeks every summer .
I also enjoy the peace and quiet of where I live , the beautiful scenery and daily walks by the sea. 
I have recently started studying Art at a local college for 3 days a week.
I enjoy playing the guitar badly, riding my bicycle and swim regularly (snorkeling in the sea here is brilliant). I enjoy a good book, even though it takes me a while to get through it sometimes. Love playing my old vinyl and tape collection. Enjoy my visitors, and getting to know people from different cultures or backgrounds. Oh, and love a good game of backgammon and the odd glass of wine, or pint of Guinness. I like talking to and getting to know my guests but can be just in the background if that's what is preferred.

Review Sept 17... ""Spacious Period Home,” Galway Centre a few minutes away: 
A dream vacation! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
A large family group made the long-awaited trip to Ireland. Ray helped to make this the most memorable experience ever! Banba House was perfect for our needs and close to Galway as well. Ray arranged a number of tours for us with drivers who went out of their way to accommodate everything we wanted to do. We even went to the pubs in Galway when Ray played and had a blast. He was the ultimate host and the house was amazing...I would go back in a second (and hope to at some point)!

BANBA HOUSE     
Banba House,  Galway Main St -12 - 15 mins.        
Built 1890, 3000 sq ft  historic home.
Large corner lot, lush mature gardens, majestic Chestnut, Irish lime, with other broadleaf and conifer trees.
Located on a smart, traditional, quiet, tree-lined street, literally just a three-minute walk to local pubs, restaurants, and shopping.
We are retiring - selling at end of 2019.
Home away from home., that’s Banba House.

While planning to travel abroad for work, I bought my old family home in Kilfinane, Co. Limerick which my parents had built in the early 60’s and reared their 7 children there .

While planning what to do I was returning home a lot more as our junior hurling team, Blackrock, won the All Ireland gold in 2009 and I found myself falling in love with the old village, it’s mountain and it’s people again. I decided to invest my future back in my home town and came up with the idea of a luxury hostel.

Then I went about designing it and finally securing planning in May 2012. I then secured funding and started building in August 2013. Thankfully with a lot of luck and help from good friends, family, neighbours and especially some very understanding contractors and workers, we opened our doors in June 2014. 

Even more thankfully, in July 2015 my wifeTeresa, a farmer’s daughter from Sligo, working as a National School Teacher in Ballyfermot, moved down and now it’s just the two of us who run, work and live in Ballyhoura Luxury Hostel.",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/79fa1ea4-204e-4161-92f2-2ad821f4640b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/79fa1ea4-204e-4161-92f2-2ad821f4640b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1.0,8.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Kilfinane, County Limerick, Ireland",52.35761,-8.47049,Entire townhouse,Entire home/apt,16,,27 baths,8.0,,"[""BBQ grill"", ""Heating"", ""Stove"", ""Bed linens"", ""Essentials"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Microwave"", ""First aid kit"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Dryer"", ""Self check-in"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Oven"", ""Hot water"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""TV"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Fireplace guards"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Building staff"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Cleaning available during stay"", ""Washer"", ""Iron"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Kitchen"", ""Wifi"", ""Hangers""]",,2,14,2.0,3.0,14.0,14.0,2.1,14.0,,,0,0,0,0,2025-09-27,2,0,0,0,0,0,,2019-01-02,2020-08-16,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,f,1,1,0,0,13120402,Cappamore-Kilmallock LEA-7,125002,Limerick City And County Council,IE051,Mid-West,0.02,This property is currently unavailable,"Apologies, this property cannot be booked instantly.

Michael:-
Retired Irish Police Officer who then followed a hobby as a photographer into the professional realms and had my own studio in Thomastown. Had a wonderful time as a professional photographer, met Clint Eastwood and many other famous people along the way. I photographed over 500 weddings and have many happy memories tucked away in negative form in a filing cabinet. This is now converted in the attached listing.  I have lived in Jerusalem with my family during the 1970's and worked with UN.  As a result love to travel back there  and keep a keen interest in developments in that part of the world. In the past year (2013). Love cycling and have toured Ireland on an electric bicycle, lazy maybe but lovely when going uphill. Enjoy plays, classical music but also oldies from 50's and 60's. Reading with Kobo ereader  and using the ipad and other gadgets floats my boat also! Love nothing better than getting up early in the morning, going for a 5 mile walk,and listening to some podcasts, news or music on earphones. Am really conservative as far as food goes, movies favourite is Circle of Friends as I recall it being made just five miles away in Inistioge.

Review Sept 17... ""Spacious Period Home,” Galway Centre a few minutes away: 
A dream vacation! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
A large family group made the long-awaited trip to Ireland. Ray helped to make this the most memorable experience ever! Banba House was perfect for our needs and close to Galway as well. Ray arranged a number of tours for us with drivers who went out of their way to accommodate everything we wanted to do. We even went to the pubs in Galway when Ray played and had a blast. He was the ultimate host and the house was amazing...I would go back in a second (and hope to at some point)!

BANBA HOUSE

It really is a 15 minute walk to the centre - I consider George's St the start of the action. (If your Guide book is saying the centre is O'Connell St, then maybe officially yeah, but you wouldn't want to hang out there. Trust me, it's George's Street) Food, music, shopping, coffee, people watching - all taken care of in that area
St. Patrick's Cathedral is nearby with the park adjoining it. And up the hill from that is Christchurch. 
I love food - eating it, cooking, buying it, having people over, so I adore that right by the house is a Lidl supermarket with great fresh produce - the fruit and veg are great and they usually have a selection of fresh fish too. 
Not to mention the bakery which bakes all day!
It's so easy to fall out of bed, round the corner and get whatever I need. Even after a big night out.
They have a good selection of beer and wine too.


This is a small city so I bike everywhere, the Dublin City bikes are great if you're a visitor. There are stations everywhere. But I think what visitors mostly say about this city is how accessible it is, you really can walk everywhere (well, to most of the worth seeing places)



Before considering booking please note:
I do actually live in this little house, most of the time so it's only available when I'm on holidays or at weekends (I'll go stay with friends or my parents)
I will try to consider any requests that I get. I know how tough it is to get a nice place in a capital city.
Please let me know when you'll be arriving so that I can do my best to be available or get a keyholder to be there. This isn't always possible as I work 9 to 5 Monday to Friday. 

I'm mentioning this because it's a question I got asked, but yes bed linen and towels are provided!
Please let me know how many are staying and I'll leave out plenty.

I provide shampoo, conditioner, showergel, toothpaste and face wipes also.

There are notes in the house for the heating, hot water and wifi password.

There's usually tea, coffee, condiments, oils, dressings, spices, herbs and basic food stuffs in the house (rice, pasta, noodles, cous cous, beans) - please feel free to use any of it .... if it's there!

Review Sept 17... ""Spacious Period Home,” Galway Centre a few minutes away: 
A dream vacation! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
A large family group made the long-awaited trip to Ireland. Ray helped to make this the most memorable experience ever! Banba House was perfect for our needs and close to Galway as well. Ray arranged a number of tours for us with drivers who went out of their way to accommodate everything we wanted to do. We even went to the pubs in Galway when Ray played and had a blast. He was the ultimate host and the house was amazing...I would go back in a second (and hope to at some point)!

BANBA HOUSE     
Banba House,  Galway Main St -12 - 15 mins.        
Built 1890, 3000 sq ft  historic home.
Large corner lot, lush mature gardens, majestic Chestnut, Irish lime, with other broadleaf and conifer trees.
Located on a smart, traditional, quiet, tree-lined street, literally just a three-minute walk to local pubs, restaurants, and shopping.
We are retiring - selling at end of 2019.
Home away from home., that’s Banba House.

The Eircode for Google Maps to bring you to my house is R95 D96V.  If you do not have access to Google Maps, please follow the instructions below:- 
From Kilkenny - Take the N77 (Castlecomer Road) out of Kilkenny and follow tthe road until you come to a junction about 6km outside Kilkenny which will be signposted Durrow/Ballyragget to the left (N77).  Keep on this road and drive through Ballyragget towards Durrow.  DO NOT TAKE THE FIRST ROAD WHICH IS SIGNPOSTED LISDOWNEY.  Instead, continue on the N77 for about 2km until you pass Glanbia Factory on the left.  The next road on the left immediately after Glanbia is signposted for Lisdowney (Road Number L5833)4km.  Take this left and drive for 2.7km.  My home is on the right hand side.  No gate.  Gravel driveway.  With a bit of luck, you have arrived!

Ennis gets its name from the Irish word “inis” (island) because it is virtually surrounded by the River Fergus, a melodious presence throughout. The streets of Ennis are narrow and charming, with many areas pedestrianized. There are plenty of locals here—Ennis is no tourist trap—and you’ll hear voices that are raised in laughter or storytelling in bakeries and bookstores alike. The Friary at the bottom of Abbey Street was founded by the O’Briens in the 13th century. Many of its original features survive. It’s breath-taking and has a textured silence that speaks through the centuries.<br /><br />Why the Owner Chose Ennis:<br />The main attraction in Ennis is the locals’ love of traditional Irish music. The town is renowned as a hub of 'trad' music, and musicians of the highest quality are on display in the pubs of Ennis throughout the year.

We’re brothers Anthony & Vinny McCay and  we run The Bastion. Our street is named after the Royal Bastion which once occupied the street where we are.

 Our house is a bit of a labyrinth inside. There's lots of history here. The world famous Irish tenor John Count McCormack often visited in the early 1900s.  Our great great grandfather Michael Kilkelly was his first tutor.

Our style is laid back and relaxed. We love good food and the left bank area  is a gourmet district with lots of great restaurants and pubs. You definitely won't go hungry here.  Ireland's Oldest Bar is just down the hill. There is music most evenings. 

The beautiful river Shannon is just at the end of the street. The imposing and enormous stone castle built by King John in 1210 majestically guards the river crossing. 

In 1691 the area was besieged by the armies of King William of Orange in a battle with King James for the English throne.  Twelve thousand cannon balls were fired across the river in the barrage that ensued. We have one of them!

You are very welcome.

Your hosts: James, Megan and 2 busy kids are happy to facilitate your stay and help you explore the area. 

We lived in the brick Dublin house from 2004-2014. Before moving in, we reinvented the interior of the house to create a bright open space with a total remodel. We love our first home here in this truly unique award winning North Dublin neighbourhood. This property is now rented full-time.

The blue Victorian house is our family home in Boise, Idaho in another wonderfully appreciated historic neighborhood (USA now, proper spellings). We are walking distance from downtown in the city's East End. The quiet apartment is above our family home. It has a seperate entrance and all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. It’s been updated and set up for short term contract professionals - but we host tourists too. This location is ideal. 

The Cheerful Cottage is located in central Nampa, Idaho and James worked hard during 2021 to bring this previously neglected property some new life.  In July 2022 it became ready for you to enjoy.  An adorable 1 bedroom property with a fenced shady yard and relaxing patio bordered by a single car garage. A bright quiet space with everything you need for a short or long term visit.
